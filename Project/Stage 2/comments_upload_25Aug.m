% design a calculator to reduce computational errors when using equations
% for Chemistry IB Test 1

% test is in end of week 6 so content from weeks 1-5

% equations include:

% PV = nRT - need to account for different R values hence different units
% for pressure and volume

% if we create one for calculating enthalpies where we can say -i + 1/2 ii
% - 3 iii??

% one for molar mass?? would need to incorporate the molar mass of all
% elements in periodic table? create one in excel?

% create pictures that pop-up prompts for equations like writing the
% equilibrium constants i.e. Kc = [products/reactants] and Kp =
% p[products]/p[reactants] where only gases are considered etc...

% a choice of pop-up for K or a calculator?

% one for quadratic formula and pop-up graph?

% deltaG = -RT ln K with pop up for unit reminders

% scientific notation aid??

% K = Ae^(Ea/RT)

% pop-up for oxidation rules

% rules to balance redox reactions

% cell notation + examples
